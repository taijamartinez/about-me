    <h2><u>About Me</h2></u>
    <ul>
        <font size="4">Let's start with the basics. <br>My name is Taija Martinez just incase you decided to skip the top introduction. My birthday is November 26, 1992 which makes me 31 years old and also a Sagittarius.<br> I am married with two kids and two pets, so I have 5 children in total. Now, I bet you're intrigued to see them. View exhibit A and B below to see their <i>beautiful</i> faces.</font><br><br><br><br><br>

      <img src="./assets/pets.jpg" alt="Your Image"> </center><br> <br>
     <center><font size="4">So you agree? They are beautiful.</center> <br> Moving along.<br> My hobbies consist of work, kids sports, yelling at dogs, makeup and fitness. Other than that, you can catch me at home, playing board games with my husband.<br> It's literally our favorite thing to do. You should note that I am a natural big back and I <b>LOVE</b> food. I like to cook and make many Puerto Rican dishes for family and friends.<br> I just recently started a new venture. Can you guess what it is? Mhm.... coding! That's the only reason why I made this page. Is it basic? Yes. Will I get better? Also yes.<br> See how I believe in myself? Very demure.

        <h2><u>Skills</h2></u>
        <font size="4"> Honestly, I have many random skills. I can pretty much do something if I try it.<br>
        My top skill would have to be my quick comebacks. So, if you can't take the heat, get out of the kitchen.<br>
        I am good with makeup. I'm low key a chef. I can also decorate your house inside and out. I'm a personal trainer and CPR certified. I can get your testing precertified <br> through your insurance and I'm top dog in games and will more than likely win. I'm great with finances and also planning events/vacations. I was a notary at one point until I <br>accidentally let it expire. I'm good with editing photos and creating designs...on my phone. I can also, take a mean selfie when I'm in catfish mode.<br>
